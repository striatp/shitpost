## Condensed Version

### 1. Core Philosophy & Principles
Octovel emphasizes **Quality**, **Clarity**, **Consistency**, **Simplicity**, and **Proactivity**. Code must be readable, maintainable, and simple. Developers follow principles like [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself), [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)), [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), [Separation of Concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns), [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), and [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle). Decisions are documented through ADRs or RFCs. Everyone shares ownership but remains accountable, following the Boy Scout Rule: always leave code cleaner.

### 2. Language & Technology Standards
At Octovel, we support a variety of languages to build our softwares, including but not limiting to TypeScript & JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, C & C++, Rust, Go, [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), PowerShell, Bash, and more. We use stable frameworks and minimal or no dependencies at all. Each technology must go through evaluation before adoption.

---

### 3. Repository Organization
Regardless of the project you are working on, we follow a consistent repository structure. All repositories are organized under the [`octovel`](https://github.com/octovel) organization on GitHub. Each repository has a clear purpose and follows a consistent naming convention. We use branches for feature development and pull requests for code review and merging.

---

### 4. Code Style & Formatting
We enforce a consistent code style and formatting across all projects. We use tools like [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), and [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) to ensure code consistency and readability. We also use a consistent naming convention for variables, functions, and classes.

---

### 5. Version Control & Git Workflow
We use Git for version control and follow a consistent workflow. We use branches for feature development and pull requests for code review and merging. We also use [Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) for code formatting and linting. We follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for releases.

---

### 6. Code Review & Collaboration
Reviews ensure correctness and maintainability across all projects. We use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) with the help of human reviewers to ensure code quality and consistency. Pull requests must be small, documented, and tested before merging. All merges require approval and [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) validation.

---

### 7. Testing & Quality Assurance
We use a variety of testing frameworks and tools to ensure code quality and maintainability. We use unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure code correctness and reliability. We also use code coverage tools to ensure code coverage and maintainability. We follow a consistent testing workflow and use a consistent naming convention for tests.

---

### 8. Documentation Standards
We enforce a consistent documentation style and formatting across all projects. We use tools like [Markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) and [Markdown-Style-Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/style.html) to ensure documentation consistency and readability. We also use a consistent naming convention for documentation files and sections.
